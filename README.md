# WePerson
This repository contains the WePerson dataset proposed in our paper "[WePerson: Learning a Generalized Re-identification Model from All-weather Virtual Data](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3474085.3475455)".

## Dataset Description

The WePerson dataset is generated by [GTA V](https://www.rockstargames.com/gta-v) with [Script Hook V](http://www.dev-c.com/gtav/scripthookv/) and [scripthookvdotnet](https://github.com/crosire/scripthookvdotnet). This is the largest synthetic person re-identification dataset that includes 4,000,000 images from 1,500 identities. Images in the dataset are collected with **40 viewpoints per scene, various poses, complex backgrounds, occlusions, 7 different types of weather, 7 different types of natural illuminations**. Identities in the dataset not only have different clothes but also **wearable accessories**, such as sunglasses, hats, etc. We show some dataset properties in Fig. 2.

### Download Link
Due to the large amount of data, currently only a subset of WePerson is provided in Baidu Pan. 

The subset can be downloaded from the link:

The filenames are encoded as follows. Take "0000_c00_s00_T04.png" as an example,
* 0000 is the id of the person
* c00 is the id of the camera
* s00 is the id of the scene
* T04 is the current time that is related to natural illumination. 

## Experiment Results
By training person re-identification models on our dataset, we demonstrate that the model trained on virtual data outperforms the model trained on real-world dataset. Our dataset also surpasses other synthetic dataset in direct transfer. 

In direct transfer evaluation, we achieve:
